# JavaScript Games
This is a collection of JavaScript games I have created for my portfolio. They are pure JavaScript games, so no need to run any commands. Just use the live-server extension to run the website.

## Games included
### 2048
A JavaScript version of the popular game 2048. Combine tiles with the same number to reach the 2048 tile.

### RPG Game
An RPG game where the player explores a world, interacts with NPCs, and battles enemies.

### Snakes
A classic game of snakes where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food.

### Side Scroller
A side-scrolling game where the player controls a character that jumps over obstacles to reach the end of the level.

### Object Collision
A game where the player controls a character that must avoid colliding with obstacles in order to reach the end of the level.

### Getting started
To get started with the games, simply download or clone the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. Use the live-server extension to run the website.
