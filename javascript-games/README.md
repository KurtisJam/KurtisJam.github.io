# JavaScript Games
This is a collection of JavaScript games I have created for my portfolio. They are pure JavaScript games, so no need to run any commands. You can use the live-server extension on vscode to run the website or visit [Javascript Games - Portfolio](https://kurtismason1995.github.io/javascript-games/index.html).

## Games included
### 2048
A JavaScript version of the popular game 2048. Combine tiles with the same number to reach the 2048 tile.

### RPG Game
An RPG game where the player explores a world, interacts with NPCs, and battles enemies.

### Snakes
A classic game of snakes where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food.

### Side Scroller
A side-scrolling game where the player controls a character that jumps over obstacles to reach the end of the level.
This was created with the help of the online youtube tutorial "*JavaScript Game Development Course for Beginners*"

### Object Collision
A game where the player controls a character that must avoid colliding with obstacles in order to reach the end of the level.
